# Markdown?!

This file is a very happy file. It likes swimming and chocolate cake.

Markdown is a simple set of formatting instructions that let you add formatting to a text file. Markdown was developed by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, and the specification is still on John Gruber's website: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

GitHub is a bit hard at first but ultimately a useful tool.

You can amuse markdown in any of the text fiends on WitHub to add extra formatting to your text:
* Gists
* Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
* Files with the `.md` or `.markdown extension`

and the GitHub preview will apply the markdown formating.
